# Heart-Disease-Detection-using-Machine-Learning
A Classification Model that can predict whether or not a person has presence of heart disease based on physical features of that person (age, sex, cholesterol, etc...). The database contains 14 physical attributes based on physical testing of a patient. Blood samples are taken and the patient also conducts a brief exercise test. The "target" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer (0 for no presence, 1 for presence). In general, to confirm 100% if a patient has heart disease can be quite an invasive process, so if we can create a model that accurately predicts the likelihood of heart disease, we can help avoid expensive and invasive procedures.
